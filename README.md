# color-blind-gmail
A Gmail add-on to make it easier for color blind people to read emails.

This project is inspired by [this askamanager question](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/06/my-boss-thinks-our-new-hire-shouldnt-use-a-disabled-parking-pass-employee-flips-from-great-to-terrible-and-more.html) (#3 on the link).

# High Level Goals

People will sometimes provide in-line responses to emails. To differentiate their responses from the original email, they'll use a different color text. This works well with many people, but is understandably difficult for color blind people who have difficulty distinguishing different colors.

The intent for this extension is to identify text in an email that is not black, and reformat it in a way that a color blind person can quickly distinguish it from the rest of the email body.
